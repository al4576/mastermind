# Mastermind

Run this application to play a simple version of Mastermind! Guess the 4-digit password where each digit ranges from 1-6. For each guess, if a digit is correct and in the correct spot a + is printed, if a digit is correct but not in the correct spot, a - is printed. All plus signs are printed before all minus signs. You have 10 guesses. Have fun and good luck!
